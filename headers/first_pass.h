/**
 * This is the first pass header file.
 * Explanation of the process:
 * When a label declaration is encountered, it validates the label and stores it with its corresponding
 * address, type, and location information. For lines that contain operations or instructions,
 * the function proceeds to scan for operands, validate them, and then convert the operation into machine code.
 * If an operand is a label, the function sets bits 0 and 1 in the instruction array to indicate to the second pass
 * that this label's address has not yet been coded and will need to be updated during the second pass.
 * This ensures that all label references are correctly handled later in the assembly process.
