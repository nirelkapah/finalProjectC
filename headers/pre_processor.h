/**
 * This is the pre-processing header file.
 * Explanation of the process:
 * If the line is a comment or a regular line (not related to macros), it is directly copied into a new output file with an ".am" extension.
 * When a macro call is encountered, the file replaces the call with the corresponding macro content in the new output file.
 * For macro declarations, the file first validates the declaration. If the declaration is valid, the macro's content is stored for later use,
 * but the macro declaration and its content are not added to the output file.
 * The end result is a new file that has all macro declarations removed and all macro calls replaced with their corresponding content,
 * providing a simplified file ready for further processing by the assembler.
