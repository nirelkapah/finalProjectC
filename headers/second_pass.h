/**
 * This is the second pass header file.
 * Explanation of the process:
 * This is final step in the assembly process.
 * Instead of reading line by line again, this file scans the instruction array for uncoded label addresses marked by the first pass.
 * For each uncoded label, it retrieves the address from the corresponding label operand that was identified in the first pass.
 * If the operand label was defined during the first pass, its address is retrieved and updated in the instruction array.
 * This approach is efficient, as it avoids redundant file reading and directly addresses only the necessary updates.
